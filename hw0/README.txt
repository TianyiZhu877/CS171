How to use:
cd to each part folders, run:
$ make clean; make all
Ingore the warnings. Then run the executables, same arguments as required by the assignment
The name of the excutables are:
Part1 -> hw0_p1
Part2 -> hw0_p2
Part3 -> hw0_p3
Part4 -> ppm_test

Most of the cpps only contain main() functions. Many shared headers are in ./utils
The deprecated Egien/Array header is removed (already done so in this zip), to avoid collision with std::array
